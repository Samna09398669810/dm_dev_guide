Empowerment of DM team members
##############################

As a DM team member, you are empowered by the DM Project Manager (PM) and DM Subsystem Scientist (SS) to make decisions on any DM-internal matter --- including technical/algorithm issues, process improvements, and tool choices --- provided that **all** of these criteria are met:

1. You, or team members who agree with you, are willing and able to do the work to implement the decision,

2. You (collectively) are willing and able to fix any problems if it goes wrong.

3. You believe that all affected parties (including your immediate manager) would not seriously object to your decision and implementation.

**If these criteria aren't satisfied,** you can still promote your proposal by creating a :doc:`Request for Comments </communications/rfc>`.
