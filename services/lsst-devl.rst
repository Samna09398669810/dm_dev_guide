Using the lsst-devl Servers
###########################

The ``lsst-devl`` nodes were a set of servers run by NCSA for Rubin Observatory development work.

.. ATTENTION::
  **NCSA servers were turned off on Aug 29, 2022.**

  Developers should instead use the USDF :doc:`lsst-login <../usdf/lsst-login>` node and associated :doc:`batch processing resources <../usdf/batch>`.
