Using the lsst-dev Server
#########################

The ``lsst-dev`` nodes were a set of servers run by NCSA for Rubin Observatory development work.

.. ATTENTION::
  **The NCSA lsst-dev servers were turned off on Oct 1, 2020.**

  Developers should instead use :doc:`lsst-login <lsst-login>` and/or :doc:`lsst-devl <lsst-devl>` nodes.
