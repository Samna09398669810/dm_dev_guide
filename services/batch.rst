Using the Rubin Batch Systems
#############################

The NCSA **HTCondor DAC Cluster**, **HTCondor Prod Cluster** and **Slurm Cluster** batch processing nodes were a set of servers run by NCSA for Rubin Observatory development work.

.. ATTENTION::
  **NCSA servers were turned off on Aug 29, 2022.**

  Developers should instead use the USDF :doc:`lsst-login <../usdf/lsst-login>` node and associated :doc:`batch processing resources <../usdf/batch>`.
