Using the lsst-login Servers
############################

The following login load-balancer is run by SLAC for access to select Rubin Observatory development resources at SLAC:

- ``sdf.slac.stanford.edu``

Connecting and Authenticating
=============================

You can ssh into Rubin Observatory development servers at SLAC with your Windows account and password. Use the load balancer:

``rubin-dev.slac.stanford.edu``

You'll need to ssh into an SDF login server once to establish your home directory etc. From then on you can choose access via ssh or the browser portal, https://sdf.slac.stanford.edu
