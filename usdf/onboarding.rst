4)	Once the SLUO registration form is submitted, the VUE center Coordinator receives an email notification of the completed form.

5)	The VUE center Coordinator sends an email to the SLAC Point of
	Contact (POC) listed on the form and asks to confirm the registration. 
6)	After the POC confirms the registration, the VUE Center Coordinator sends an email of the onboarding request form SLAC Site Access Portal | Coming to SLAC (stanford.edu) to the new user with instructions in how to complete the form.

7)	When the user submits the onboarding request form, the form is
	then sent to several approvers before a SLAC ID is granted.
	
	If the user is a US citizen, the completed onboarding form is
	first routed to the SLAC poc then to the SLAC HR team for SLAC
	ID duplicate check and issue the SLAC ID number.

	If the user is a non-US citizen, the completed onboarding form is first routed to the SLAC poc then to the VUE Center Coordinator and to the SLAC HR team for SLAC ID duplicate check and issue the SLAC ID number.

8)	After the SLAC SID number is issued, the VUE Center Coordinator completes the user’s SLUO registration form and sends an email to the user with instructions of the next steps. The email instructs the users to complete the SLAC Cyber 100 training and to email the SLAC poc to request for a SLAC account.  

9)	The SLAC poc submits a ticket to IT requesting a SLAC account
	for the new user.

10) SLAC IT will send a url to the user to reset their initial
    passwords

11) SLAC Cyber training must be done within 2 weeks to keep the
    account enabled.
