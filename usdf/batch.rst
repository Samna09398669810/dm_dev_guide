Batch Resources
#################

This document describes the batch resources available at the LSST Data
Facility during the interim period where the Rubin filesystems at SLAC
go into production mode on our own hardware, and while user and
project data are being transferred from NCSA.

Use of SDF batch is documented at

https://sdf.slac.stanford.edu/public/doc/#/batch-compute

Rubin currently has 7 128 core Romes in its rubin partition. No
special batch queues exist yet.
