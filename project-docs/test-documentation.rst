Test Documentation
##################

Verification and Validation activities require a huge amount of work in terms of documentation.
Often this documentation work is given a lower priority, compromising in this way the visibily of the V&V actvities.

The introduction of the Test Manager 4 Jira plugin (TM4J), helps the test team in overcome this problem.
This, combined with the programmatic extraction usinf docsteady, brings also additional benefits:

- Test information becomes much more accesible
- Traceability between test objects and with upstream requirements
- Facilitate reusability of test procedures
- The test teams remains more focused on the scienfic aspect of the tests
- Ensure homogeneity in the approach

However, in order to make this possible, it is important to follow a well organized approach to the V&V activities. 

You can get a global overview of the process in ths `SPIE paper`_ presented in December 2020.
The `DM Test Approach`_ Confluence page instead, provides more practical informations including details on how to create each TM4J object, how they are related each other, and how to fill in the right information.
