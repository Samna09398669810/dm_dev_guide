Mailing lists

Email is not the preferred mode of contact within DM but there are several project mailing lists in use.
The full set can be found at `Mailing lists`_. 
These lists are mainly populated by the Contacts Database groups.

The relevant lists for DM are:
- `dm-cams <https://lists.lsst.org/mailman/listinfo/dm-cams>`_: Data Management CAM's
- `dm-sst <https://lists.lsst.org/mailman/listinfo/dm-sst>`_: DM System Science Team
- `dm-staff <https://lists.lsst.org/mailman/listinfo/dm-staff>`_: All DM construction staff 

However, these are seldom used and mentioned here for completeness.
